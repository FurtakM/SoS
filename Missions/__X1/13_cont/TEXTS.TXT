@ Triangulation
% After the uneasy truce of winter, Burlak must return with his troops to the battlefield to destroy the enemies of the Red Army.

// Dialogue Start 
$ DStart-Bur-1
- What are these lines on the map?
$ DStart-Bys-1
- They note the Alaskite deposits. You see, the concentration increases when we go in this direction.
$ DStart-Bur-2
- There is a greater reserve in this area?
$ DStart-Bys-2
- We have been assessing this all winter comrade commander. We think you are right, but this is deposit is not just larger, it is massive. We call it "The Motherlode".
$ DStart-Bur-3
- This is what we came here for Bystrov. I should have been informed sooner! Where is the location?
$ DStart-Bys-3
- We did not make report yet because we are not sure of the reference. We could find it using data from other nation's mines....
$ DStart-Bur-4
- Then we must attack them!
$ DStart-Bys-4
- It does seem there is another way, comrade major. Our research into the Artefact has shown that it can  indicate the direction toward the Motherlode. So if we have several such observations...
$ DStart-Bur-5
- ... where the lines intersect is the location!
$ DStart-Bys-5
- Precisely comrade major. And the further apart these observations are, the more accurate the result will be.
$ DStart-Bur-6
- Show me the best locations for obtaining data and we'll get it for you.

// Dialogue Arrival 
$ DArrival-Bur-1
- This is deep in US territory Bystrov, how much further do you want us to go?.
$ DArrival-Bys-1
- First we take the Artefact as far North as possible and then the same to the East. There we take the measurements. The further we go, the better the measurements will be. But we shall need labs equipped for space-time research at these locations.
$ DArrival-Bur-2
- Let's get going then.

# MStart
Add main North
-Take Artefact North, build space-time lab and use the Artefact to locate Motherlode
Add main East
-Take Artefact East, build space-time lab and use the Artefact to locate Motherlode
#

# MFinish
Add main Return
- Return to South-West corner with Artefact.
#

// Dialogue BadBase (depending on the situation, the depot will be built anyway, this is just reminder)
$ DBadBase-Bys-1
- This base will not be far enough North, comrade commander.
$ DBadBase-Bys-1a
- This base will not be far enough East, comrade commander.

// Dialogue BasLab (when lab is North or East enough)
$ DBasLab-Bys-1
- We can't use this lab to take measurements. It's too far South.
$ DBasLab-Bys-1a
- We can't use this lab to take measurements. It's too far West.

// Dialogue NoArtefact (space-time lab but Artefact not in base)
$ DNoArtefact-Bys-1
- We need the Artefact to take measurements, comrade commander.

// Dialogue Done (AT is researched in North)
$ DDone-Bys-1
- [first] We have taken the measurements from this point. Now we must do the same in the other direction.
$ DDone-Bys-1a
- [second] Now we have all the measurements we need. Let's go home, comrade commander.

# MOutNorth
Out North

# MOutEast
Out East

// Dialogue TimeLapser1 (when first measurement is completed)
$ DTimeLapser1-Sci1-1
- I think it's a pity if we leave it here. I've a couple of ideas about that Alaskite tau-field. Maybe we can continue research here?

// Dialogue TimeLapser2 (time-lapser researched)
$ DTimeLapser2-Sci1-1
- Our work has been successful, comrade commander. We now have a device that can emit a large scale tau-field - it will slow down everything within it.
$ DTimeLapser2-Bur-1
- Including us!?
$ DTimeLapser2-Sci1-2
- No, we have built in protection for us. It will only decelerate our enemies so we can destroy them at our leisure!

// Dialogue ArtefactSteal 
$ DArtefactSteal-Bur-1
- Those Yankee bastards have stolen the Artefact! Get it back before they drive away!

// Dialogue JMMStart (some time into the mission)
$ DJMMStart-Gla-1
- (over radio) Comrade Gorky, we've intercepted an American transmission. It seems one of their best commanders, John Macmillan, has defected to the Alliance. On his way he will pass through your territory.
$ DJMMStart-Bur-1
- (into radio) Thank you, comrade Gladkov. I have a score to settle with him.
$ DJMMStart-Kuz-1
- [present] Macmillan is a smart bastard. We'll be lucky to kill him.
$ DJMMStart-Gny-1
- [present] Macmillan? He is no fool. I don't think we can catch him.
$ DJMMStart-Ptr-1
- [present] Macmillan? I'll kill the bastard with my bare hands, if I have to.

// Dialogue JMMAppear 
$ DJMMAppear-RSol1-1
- Quick! Macmillan's here!

// Dialogue JMMEscapes 
$ DJMMEscapes-RSol1-1
- The bastard got away!
$ DJMMEscapes-Kuz-1
- [present] It was Macmillan. He was never going to be caught.
$ DJMMEscapes-Gny-1
- [present] Did you expect him not to? Macmillan is a smart guy.

// Dialogue JMMDies 
$ DJMMDies-Bur-1
- I promised I would kill you Macmillan. Now you know Burlak is a man of his word.
$ DJMMDies-Gny-1
- [present] You killed Macmillan! I can't believe it! You are a hero comrade Burlak.
$ DJMMDies-RSol1-1
- [otherwise] We got John Macmillan. We can take him we can take them all!
