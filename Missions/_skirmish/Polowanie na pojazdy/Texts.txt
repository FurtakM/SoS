& Car Driver - Sand of Siberia by Serpent.

// Dialogue 1i (very short while after the start of the mission - in-game video)
$ D1i-Off-1
- Now, create platoons: four soldiers, two technicians, one medic. Immediately after landing free the area so that your comrades can come as well. Regroup your formation. Don't forget your code name. Make contact with general Makarov, call sign Eagle, and wait for orders.

// Dialogue 1 (immediately after the start of the mission)
$ D1-Bur-1
- So here I am. Strange, it almost didn't change at all. (A beat. Burlak moves aside quickly.)
$ D1-Bur-1a
- So what's holding them? And where is everybody? (into radio) Hello, this Robin 5, Robin 5 calling Eagle. Do you read me? (static over radio)
$ D1-Bur-1b
- It's broken. Well, I guess I have to take a look around. And better be careful, there might be those Americans near.

// Dialogue Waterfall (when see waterfall)
$ DWaterfall-Bur-1
- What a beauty! I need some dialogue to comment this scenery.

// Dialogue Corpse (when see corpse of mastodon)
$ DCorpse-Bur-1
- Ufff. I need some dialogue here. I cannot pass such a terrible thing and not to comment it.

Unit Control
For the time being you can control only one character, mechanic 3rd class, Yuri Ivanovich Gorky. You can select him by left clicking. Above him, you can see a bar that indicates his condition.

You can issue orders to your selected unit - if you right-click on a location you order your character to move there. Right-clicking an enemy is the order to attack him. You can try it now, while looking for your comrades. If you think you need more advice, click on the button on this screen to open on-line help.

// Dialogue 2 (meeting with Apemen)
$ D2-Bur-1
- These must be our prehistoric ancestors. They have a long way to go, before work turns them into humans. (To Nick: This is actually a pun on well-known (in USSR) Engels' work: "The role of work in humanizing the Ape")
$ D2-Bur-1a
- [Apeman attacks him] They are aggressive, buggers. Better be careful.

// Dialogue 3 (meeting with Gnyevko, Burlak didn't meet anybody yet.. Gneyvko has profession of an engineer, but has higher soldier skill)
$ D3-Bur-1
- Hello! Who are you? What happened to you?
$ D3-Gny-1
- Corporal Gnyevko, 21st platoon, call sign Sparrow 3. I appeared here couple of days ago, but those fucking Apes stole my kit and gave me a beating of my life. I'm hiding ever since. Never seen any fucking American, or any of our guys.
$ D3-Bur-2
- My radio is broken. I think we should go together now. We'll have more chance this way.
$ D3-Gny-2
- Suit yourself, ...
$ D3-Bur-3
- Name is Gorky, but everybody calls me Burlak.
$ D3-Gny-3
- Suit yourself, Burlak. Lead the way.

Controlling more units
Now you have another character, Semyon I. Gnyevko. If you left-click him, you will select him instead of Burlak and all orders will be issued to him.

If you have a unit selected you can hold down Shift and left-click another unit - then you will have both selected. You can also hold down the left mouse button and drag a box around the units you want to select.

// Dialogue 3a (meeting with Gnyevko, Burlak met Pokryshkin. Gneyvko has profession of an engineer, but has higher soldier skill)
$ D3a-Sol1-1
- Hello! Who are you? What happened to you?
$ D3a-Gny-1
- Corporal Gnyevko, 21st platoon, call sign Sparrow 3. I appeared here couple of days ago, but those fucking Apes stole my kit and gave me a beating of my life. I'm hiding ever since. Never seen any fucking American, nor any of our guys.
$ D3a-Bur-1
- [present] I'm Yuri Ivanovich Gorky, but everybody calls me Burlak. Come with us, these guys here know where is our base here. It seems it is more complicated here than we thought.
$ D3a-Sol1-2
- [otherwise] All right, go with me. We are just returning to our base.
$ D3a-Gny-2
- [reply] Great, I am really sick of hiding before monkeys. Lead the way.

// Dialogue 4 (meeting with Pokryshkin)
$ D4-Pok-1
- Halt! Who are you?
$ D4-Gny-1
- [present] Corporal Gnyevko, 21st platoon, call sign Sparrow 3. (Switches colour to that of Pokryshkin).
$ D4-Pok-2
- [Burlak too far] ***Welcome on board.
$ D4-Gny-2
- [reply] ***There is one of our mechanics in area, his radio is broken...

$ D4-Gny-3
- [reply, when Burlak really arrives] ***To je on...
$ D4-Bur-3
- Mechanic 3rd class, Yuri I. Gorky. Call sign Robin 5. Where is everybody? Who are you?
$ D4-Pok-4
- You've just arrived, haven't you? Forget all that crap about platoons and call signs. Nobody plays by these rules here. It's different here than we thought-
$ D4-Bur-4
- ***Co to bylo za ránu?
$ D4-Pok-5
- ***Pssst... wait...
$ D4-Ame-5
- (over radio) Lieutenant Charles Brown calling Alpha. Alpha do you read me?
$ D4-Pok-6
- Now watch and learn!
$ D4-Pok-6a
- ***(into radio - with different accent, so that the player can understand he speaks English now, not Russian) We read you loud and clear. Move east, hledej skupinu tøí stromù na kopci. We send search party to meet you.
$ D4-Pok-6b
- (to Burlak) Now go with us. I'm lieutenant Mikhail Vasilyevich Pokryshkin.

! Follow
Friendly units
Commander of this group is lieutenant Pokryshkin. This means that you cannot directly control him. We say that he and his men are your allies. You can see they have different colour than you (pink instead of red). Allied units share the fog of war with you (you can see what they can see and vice versa), but you cannot control these units.
All units on the map are in one of three states: allied, neutral or enemy. If you right-click an allied unit you issue order "follow unit" while you issue "attack unit" if you right-click enemy or neutral unit. If your unit spots an enemy unit it will try to attack it automatically, while in case of allied or neutral unit it will take no action.

// Dialogue Split (if Burlak moves further than 15 hexes from Pokryshkin)
$ DSplit-Pok-1
- Where are you going, Gorky? I told you to stick with us!
$ DSplit-Bur-1
- I'm sorry, lieutenant. (in-game video, Burlak walks back to Pokryshkin)

// Dialogue Attack (if Burlak tries to attack one of the Pokryshkin's men)
$ DAttack-Pok-1
- You must be crazy, Gorky, or you are a spy. Either way, I'll get rid of you now. Kill him! (All Russians attack Burlak)

// Dialogue 5 (meeting with Brown)
$ D5-Ame-1
- Welcome-Oh, hell...
$ D5-Pok-1
- Sure, Yank. Get him, boys. (Russians open fire at American)
$ D5-Ame-2
- It was a trap! (dies)
$ D5-Bur-2
- So that's how we fight Americans here...
$ D5-Pok-2
- We mustn't allow them to make contact. It's easiest to take the suckers out while they don't know what hit them.
$ D5-Bur-3
- I see.
$ D5-Bel-3
- It's easy and it's fun. Did you see him wriggle?
$ D5-Pok-3
- I don't think it's fun, Pyotr Mikhailovich. But if they come here to steal from us, they can't expect anything else.
$ D5-Gny-3
- [present] But this isn't war. It's just plain murder!
$ D5-Bur-4
- This is war. We have our duties, just as they do. They must know then can die here, just as I do know it.

! Kill
Death of your character

Your character was killed. This means that you cannot carry on with the game - your character is YOU within the game world, if he or she is killed, you have to restart the mission to give him or her another chance.
Your character can withstand some damage and survive, but everybody eventually has to give in. To avoid getting killed try to get out of the heaviest fire, never try to take on more than one character and whenever possible, try to get local firepower superiority.

// Dialogue 6 (order to attack Gladstone - short while after Brown)
$ D6-Pok-1
- So, now we can head back to S. M. Kirov.
$ D6-Bur-1
- Where?
$ D6-Pok-2
- Oh, I explained you no nothing yet, did I? So, listen my boy, if Americans built that TOWAR we used to get here, they did pretty lousy job of it, they did. No matter when you entered it, you might appear here today and just as well three years ago - or three years from now, you could!
$ D6-Bel-2
- *** And you can appear anywhere... já jsem musel putovat dva dny, než jsem nìkoho potkal...
$ D6-Bur-2
- Oh... and how long are we here?
$ D6-Pok-3
- The first Russian we know to arrive here, was comrade colonel Morozov, and it was on 7th Novemer, last year - today, it's March 13, 2 NR, or year two New Reckoning. He founded base V. I. Lenin-
$ D6-Kur-3
- (over radio) Mikhail, there are some Yanks North of you. Take your men and take them out. They are getting too arrogant these days.
$ D6-Pok-4
- (into radio) Roger that, Kirov. On my way. (To Burlak) I'll tell you more later. Now we have to go there.
$ D6-Bel-4
- Some action, finally! Hope they'll put up a good fight!

// Dialogue 7 (attack on Gladstone - when they spot the first breastwork)
$ D7-Pok-1
- So here it is. Ready your guns and charge!
$ D7-Bel-1
- ***Uraaaa!!!
$ D7-FASol-1
- ***Hey, Tim, there are some Russians attacking me... yes, I think I can... OK...

// Dialogue 7a (attack on Gladstone - when Pokryshkin dies)
$ D7a-Bel-1
- Comrade Pokryshkin!
$ D7a-Sol1-1
- Retreat everybody! We don't have a chance here!
$ D7a-FASol-1
- ***OK, Time, utíkají...

// Dialogue 7b (attack on Gladstone - after retreat)
$ D7b-Bel-1
- This is terrible! What shall we do now?
$ D7b-FSol1-1
- Obviously, frontal attack is not an option.
$ D7b-Bel-2
- But how is it possible? Mikhail Vasiliyevich was such a good soldier...
$ D7b-Sol1-2
- I've had enough. Mikhail Vasiliyevich is dead and he was the commander. We have to return to Kirov for orders.
$ D7b-Bel-3
- [burlak too far] Moje øeè. Ale mìli bychom poèkat na toho mechanika, Burlaka.
$ D7b-Bel-3a
- [burlak returns] Už je tady... pojï, vracíme se na Kirov.
$ D7b-Bur-3
- Do you think so? I'd say our orders were quite clear, comrade: destroy this base. Isn't there a better way how to attack it?
$ D7b-FSol1-3
- Well, we might take a look around... Maybe we can take cover behind trees.
$ D7b-Bel-4
- Are you crazy? We have to bring here reinforcements.
$ D7b-Bur-4
- Couldn't they get away meanwhile? You were so eager to fight, and, after all, it's only one woman and a heap of sandbags.
$ D7b-Sol1-4
- He is right. Let's go and kick some butt.

Controlling more units

After the death of Mikhail Pokryshkin you take control of his group - it seems there is nobody else here better suited for the job. Beside Burlak, you now have other characters at your disposal. If you left-click one of them, you will select him instead of Burlak and all orders will be issued to him.

If you have a unit selected you can hold down Shift and left-click another unit - then you will have both selected. You can also hold down the left mouse button and drag a box around the units you want to select.

After the death of Mikhail Pokryshkin you take control of his group - it seems there is nobody else here better suited for the job. We have already described the controlling of more units, so you can use this knowledge again.

! Visibility
Visibility
Your character can only see what is displayed in light colours. You know the terrain in grey sections of map, but cannot see what is going in them. This means you don't know if the enemy is lurking there. You're knowledge of the black sections is negligible.

Note the fan pattern in you field of vision - you cannot see through trees or buildings, nor can the enemy see you. If you are hiding behind a tree (especially if you are on higher ground), you can see the enemy before he can see you. Use it to your advantage.

// Dialogue 10 (American base destroyed)
$ D10-Bur-1
- So we repaid our debt here. Does anybody of you can get us back to base? Did you say it is called V. I. Lenin?
$ D10-Bel-1
- [alive] You did great, Burlak. Can I call you Burlak?
$ D10-Bur-2
- [reply] Sure.
$ D10-Bel-2
- [reply] Thanks. V. I. Lenin is our main base, south from here. Our current base in this area is S. M. Kirov, east from here. I can take us there easily.
$ D10-Sol1-2
- [otherwise] We are not operating from V. I. Lenin. Our base is called S. M. Kirov, East of here. I can take us there.
$ D10-Bur-3
- Thanks
