$ DMeetVsevolodVS-Bur-1
- Sevi, how does it look?
$ DMeetVsevolodVS-Vse-1
- That road leads to the base, North East of here. Two turrets guard the way.
$ DMeetVsevolodVS-Bur-2
- Any ideas?
$ DMeetVsevolodVS-Vse-2
- We developed the stasis field you discovered in Ovsyenko, but that is all for now.. I'll lead you to the North, you can improve a lab and build a factory there while we do a little reconnaissance.

// Dialogue StasisVS (When Vsevolod goes into red)
$ DStasisVS-Tit-1
- [alive] Holy Simeon, they have landmines!
$ DStasisVS-Kir-1
- [otherwise] What is happening?
$ DStasisVS-Bur-1
- Sevi! Are you all right?
$ DStasisVS-Tit-2
- [alive] Vsevolod is wounded. We need medical attention now.
$ DStasisVS-Kir-2
- [otherwise] Comrade Gorky your brother is wounded. We need a scientist for him quickly.
$ DStasisVS-Pop-2
- (over radio) Your brother is a great asset of Red army. It is personal order of general Morozov that he must survive.
$ DStasisVS-Glb-2
- [alive] Comrade Gorky he is your brother! You have to save him.

# MVsevolod (+Sevi)
Add main Sevi
- Comrade Vsevolod I. Gorky must survive.
#

// Dialogue SeviSaved (when Savi's back in yellow)
$ DSeviSaved-Bur-1
- (anxiously) Are you all right, Sevi?
$ DSeviSaved-Vse-1
- Thanks little brother, I can manage.
$ DSeviSaved-Bur-2
- General Morozov was worried about you.
$ DSeviSaved-Vse-2
- Not surprising, the first thing I do is step on a mine! We shall follow in your footsteps now Burlak, that will be safer! (control of Vsevolod's men is transferred to Burlak)

// Dialogue MeetXavier (short time after SeviSaved; mercenay appears close to Kirilenkova)
$ DMeetXavier-Xav-1
- Here we go. (a beat) Where is everybody? Hajji? René? (turns to Kirilenkova) Yelena? I did not know you were coming.
$ DMeetXavier-Kir-1
- Who are you? What are you talking about?
$ DMeetXavier-Xav-2
- Raul Xavier. Surely you can recall, Monte Negro 2001, 1st Serbian International Brigade. I was proud to serve under you.

// Query Xavier (immediately afterward)
? QXavier
The mercenary believes he served under Yelena in a war that never happened in your world. Do you want to:
-1 Explain the situation.
-2 String him along.
?

// Dialogue QrXavier#1 
$ DQrXavier#1-Bur-1
- Explain to him, Yelena.
$ DQrXavier#1-Kir-1
- OK. Raul, I am not the same woman you met. We come from a different future. In our time the mineral you call siberite had been relocated by the Americans here to Alaska. With it they ruled the world. We are here to change this.
$ DQrXavier#1-Xav-1
- So the Americans succeeded!
$ DQrXavier#1-Kir-2
- Who knows? Perhaps they did when they were only up against your ragtag mercenary band. Now they have us to deal with.
$ DQrXavier#1-Xav-2
- This isn't the job we were paid to do.
$ DQrXavier#1-Kir-3
- Your employers are deceitful; they are also our enemy. That puts you in a difficult position!
$ DQrXavier#1-Xav-3
- I owe the Arabs nothing and I served with Russians in Monte Negro, different ones it seems! I will join you.
$ DQrXavier#1-Kir-4
- Very well. (Xavier turns the player's colour)
$ DQrXavier#1-Glb-4
- [alive] I hope you will not be sorry for this, comrade Gorky. He is a mercenary. They cannot be trusted.

// Dialogue QrXavier#2 
$ DQrXavier#2-Bur-1
- No need to be cautious, Yelena. Tell him you were there.
$ DQrXavier#2-Kir-1
- (a beat) You are right comrade Gorky. Of course I remember you Raul. So you're still on the sheikh's payroll.
$ DQrXavier#2-Xav-1
- Yeah. This time it's Yankee ass we come to kick. What the hell are you doing here?
$ DQrXavier#2-Kir-2
- We're here to protect the alaski... the siberite.
$ DQrXavier#2-Xav-2
- Good. So where are the ones who came after me?
$ DQrXavier#2-Kir-3
- It is not first in first out. We arrive separated by space and time.
$ DQrXavier#2-Xav-3
- (sarcastic) Brilliant!
$ DQrXavier#2-Kir-4
- It gets worse. The sheikhs are our enemy here. In fact we are about to annihilate their base and anyone fighting for them. Welcome to the past Xavier!
$ DQrXavier#2-Xav-4
- Yelena, I trust you as commander, you saved all our lives in Monte Negro. I will work with you. I can feed info to you from inside the base.
$ DQrXavier#2-Kir-5
- It could be useful. But cross me and you are a dead man. (Xavier leaves. He has "ally" attitude toward the player and shared LOS, so the player can see what he sees).
$ DQrXavier#2-Glb-5
- [alive] Is this a good idea comrade commander? He may just tell the Arabians we are here and they will be ready for us.

// Dialogue PointXavier (some time after Xavier reaches the Arabian base)
$ DPointXavier-Xav-1
- Kirilenkova, I found a drop box. See the big tree I stand by?
$ DPointXavier-Kir-1
- I see it.
$ DPointXavier-Xav-2
- If you want to contact me them leave a message here. I will do the same.

! Xavier
Xavier

There will be hint...

// Query ActivateXavier (when one of the player's characters walks toward drop box tree and nothing was selected yet)
? QActivateXavier
What kind of message do you want to pass to Raul Xavier?
-1 Join me here
-2 Steal a vehicle and go to our base
-3 Nothing
?

// Dialogue QrActivateXavier#1 
$ DQrActivateXavier#1-Bur-1
- Raul, please come here. We need you in our ranks.

// Dialogue QrActivateXavier#2 
$ DQrActivateXavier#2-Bur-1
- Try to capture one of their vehicles and drive to our base.

// Dialogue YashinArrives (before the attack on Arabian base)
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-1
- This is Eagle. This is Eagle, calling all stations. Do you read me?
$ DYashinArrives-Vse-1
- [present: alt a1] Marshal Yashin? Is that you?
$ DYashinArrives-Bur-1
- [otherwise: alt a2] Eagle here. Is this Marshal Yashin?
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-2
- Of course. And who the hell are you?
$ DYashinArrives-Vse-2
- [alt a1] Vsevolod I. Gorky, comrade Marshal.
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-3
- [alt a1] From the 87th Guard Tank Division!? Good to have you around again comrade Sevi. So, what's the situation?
$ DYashinArrives-Vse-3
- [alt a1] My brother can explain better, I have not been here long.
$ DYashinArrives-Bur-3
- [alt a2] This is Yuri I. Gorky, comrade Marshal. And-
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-4
- [alt a2] Gorky? Any relation to Vsevolod Gorky?
$ DYashinArrives-Bur-4
- [alt a2] He is... he was my brother.
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-5
- [alt a2] A sad loss. He was an excellent officer. So who's in charge here Gorky?
$ DYashinArrives-Bur-5
- Commander-in-chief is comrade general Morozov. Our main base, V. I. Lenin, is currently under Arabian attack.
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-6
- Arabian!?
$ DYashinArrives-Bur-6
- Yes, comrade Marshal, not everything here is as expected. Their aim is to destroy the Alaskite deposits. We are about to attack their base to ease the pressure on V. I. Lenin.
$ DYashinArrives-Yas-7
- I see. And how are your preparations? Any problems?

// Query YashinHelp
? QYashinHelp
Marshal Yashin wants to know if you have any problems in your current mission. What do you want to tell him?
-1 You have a problem with the Arabian defences?
-2 You have a problem with colonel Platonov?
-3 You have no problems.
?

// Dialogue QrYashinHelp#1 
$ DQrYashinHelp#1-Bur-1
- We have a problem with Arabian bunkers comrade marshal. They are too strong for a direct assault.
$ DQrYashinHelp#1-Yas-1
- I can see that. (walks toward bunkers) So do you have bazookas?
$ DQrYashinHelp#1-Bur-2
- Unfortunately not, comrade Marshal.
$ DQrYashinHelp#1-Yas-2
- Then tell your scientists to develop them, comrade. It wouldn't be too hard.

// Dialogue QrYashinHelp#2 
$ DQrYashinHelp#2-Bur-1
- (uncertain) Comrade Marshal, it is not for me to say but...I wonder if colonel Platonov is a little out of his depth. It is probably me that is wrong but sometimes his orders appear... confused.
$ DQrYashinHelp#2-Yas-1
- I appreciate your candour. I'll make my own assessment once I reach V. I. Lenin.

// Dialogue QrYashinHelp#3 
$ DQrYashinHelp#3-Bur-1
- Thank you, comrade Marshal, but there are no problems we can't handle.
$ DQrYashinHelp#3-Yas-1
- I admire your attitude comrade Gorky.

// Dialogue YashinLeave (immediately afterward)
$ DYashinLeave-Yas-1
- Now I need a vehicle to drive to V. I. Lenin. Give me one that's fast and strong, comrade Gorky.
$ DYashinLeave-Bur-1
- Of course, comrade Marshal.

// Dialogue YashinAttack (the player tries to attack Yashin)
$ DYashinAttack-Bur-1
- Stop! Are you crazy?

// Dialogue HeikeObj (when Arabian base is partly destroyed)
$ DHeikeObj-Pop-1
- You are doing a good job comrade Gorky. The pressure on our base has eased. The Arabians are on their way to you.
$ DHeikeObj-Bur-1
- I see, comrade major.
$ DHeikeObj-Pop-2
- Their leader is the woman Heike, you might remember. She is good. Get rid of her if you can.

- Understood, comrade major.

# MHeike (+Heike)

$ DHeikeCapt-Bur-1
