// Dialogue 1 (immediately after the start of the mission)
$ D1-A-1
- Hey, look at the bushes before us. Looks like something or someone is hidden in there.
$ D1-B-1
- Is looks like a building.
$ D1-A-2
- It must be the depot we've been told about. What do you think?
$ D1-B-2
- Let's have a closer look.
$ D1-A-3
- OK, but we have to be careful. The Russians sure are somewhere around here. Hope the bulding does not belong to them.
$ D1-A-10
- Yes, it's definitely our depot. And it seems that no comdares are wandering inside.
$ D1-B-10
- You're right, but we must be near their base. So this is the place we should build our base? It really does not look good.
$ D1-A-11
- Well, we've been told that there would be a depot near the Russian base. It is. But why the hell didn't they tell us that there is not much place for a base around here?
$ D1-B-11
- Don't ask me.
$ D1-A-12
- There is not much place on the other side of the road either. The bad thing is that the guy who built this depot was a soldier, not an engineer.
$ D1-B-12
- Oh?
$ D1-A-13
- I'm sorry, i did not mean to insult you.
$ D1-B-13
- Even if it were place to build a base here, we would have problems defending the base. If I do not count the forest, there is no obstacle that we could use for our defense.
$ D1-A-14
- That's true. So we have two possibilities: we can build the base here, or we can look for a better place. Or we can do both - build here and then start another base.
$ D1-B-14
- Maybe we should wait for the others. We two have to stay together so we cannot do two things at once.
$ D1-A-15
- That's true. When do they arrive?
$ D1-B-15
- There will arrive in two groups. The first one should be here in about 10 minutes, the other some time after them.
$ D1-A-16
- Some time?
$ D1-B-16
- Yes, some time.
$ D1-A-17
- First a depot in a forest, then 'some time'. Someone sure does not like us much. And I do not mean the Russians now.
$ D1-B-17
- When we return, we can... we can ask who the hell planned this mission. Or is the correct word 'designed'?
$ D1-A-18
- We'll sure do that. If - not when - we return. I have a bad feeling.
$ D1-A-20
- So what do we know about the Russians? Except, of course, that they should be history tomorrow and that we should be the history-makers.
$ D1-B-20
- We've learned from our spy that their base has a good automatic defense system. The weak spot is that it needs a lot of juice to operate. Disabling one of their powerplants is definitely a good idea.
$ D1-A-21
- Do we at least know where exactly their base is?
$ D1-B-21
- No. The spy did not have much time to talk before they... before he was...
$ D1-A-22
- Yes, I got the idea. Do we have a clue why the Russians are here?
$ D1-B-22
- It is possible that they are looking for a rich oil deposit. And they believe it should be somewhere around here.
# D1-A-23
- And I guess that we are not sure, as usual. So now it's up to us to learn more.
$ D1-B-23
- Sure. And we'll kick some ass here!
$ D1-A-24
- Yeah! So let's get to work.

// Dialogue 2 (first reinforcements).
$ D2-A-1
- This is beta team. Calling alpha team. Do you read me?
$ D2-B-1
- Yes, we read you. Where are you now?
$ D2-A-2
- We've just arrived near the depot.
$ D2-B-2
- Good. Meet us ASAP, for we need every hand we have here. And what about the others?
$ D2-A-3
- The gamma team is about five minutes behind us.
$ D2-B-3
- OK.

// Dialogue 3 (second reinforcements).
$ D3-A-1
- Gamma team calling base. Please respond.
$ D3-B-1
- This is alpha. Don't waste any time and hurry to meet us.
$ D3-A-2
- Sir, there is something you should know.
$ D3-B-2
- I guess it is a bad news. Go on.
$ D3-A-3
- Well not exactly. We do not know yet whether this is a bad...
$ D3-B-3
- Please get to the point.
$ D3-A-4
- Yes, sir. We've met a Russian truck. The Russians did not spot us, so most of us continued the journey here. Three of us stayed and tried to capture it.
$ D3-B-4
- And?
$ D3-A-5
- If everything went OK, they should arrive in a while. With the truck. And possibly with some information from the driver.
$ D3-B-5
- Hope they'll be here soon. And now, everyone, including your team, get to work.

// Dialogue 4 (third reinforcements).
$ D4-A-1
- Calling alpha. Calling alpha.
$ D4-B-1
- Alpha here. Are you all OK?
$ D4-A-2
- Yes, you could say that. We're OK. We've captured both Russian drivers. Unfortunatelly, we have damaged the trucks during our operation.
$ D4-B-2
- Did you learn something from the drivers?
$ D4-A-3
- First, they were not willing to tell us something, but they changed their mind fast. They were returning from the Russian base after they unloaded a full cargo of oil there. Seems that their base is short on oil.
$ D4-B-3
- Did you learn where exactly the Russian base is and what the Russians want here?
$ D4-A-4
- The base should be in the end of this road - the drivers were not able to specify exact distance.
$ D4-B-4
- Of course they could have been lying.
$ D4-A-5
- I don't think so, sir. We... we convinced them that it would be better for them to tell us the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
$ D4-B-5
- I see. And what do they want here?
$ D4-A-6
- The drivers did not know. But it seems to me that they are searching for something here.
$ D4-B-6
- Well, we might ask them when we run into them. It is no doubt that this will happen.
$ D4-A-7
- Yup.

// Dialogue 5 (having seen a pathway through the forest).
$ D5-A-1
- Look! There is a path through the forest.
$ D5-B-1
- Hope the Russians are not waiting on the end of the path.

// Dialogue 6 (having crossed the river).
$ D6-A-1
- Well, this would look like a good place for a base. We can use the river instead of building defenses.
$ D6-B-1
- The place looks fine. Too much fine. I  fear that something unpleasant is waiting here.
$ D6-A-2
- Like what?
$ D6-B-2
- Like tigers or something like that.
$ D6-A-3
- We have to be careful.

// Dialogue 7 (having constructed a depot).
$ D7-A-1
- The depot is ready!

// Dialogue 8 (having constructed a siberite mine).
$ D8-A-1
- We have the siberite mine ready.
$ D8-B-1
- I wonder whether the siberite is what the Russians are looking for. If so, we should prepare for a surprise visit from them.

// Dialogue 9 (siberite mine destroyed).
$ D9-A-1
- Oh, shit. The bastards have destroyed the siberite mine.

// Dialogue 10 (having seen the Russian base).
$ D10-A-1
- I have located the Russian base. Repeat. I have located the Russian base.
