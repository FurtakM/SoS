$ DI-2-BaseCaptured
- What about Russians?

$ DP-2-BaseCaptured
- Our scouts reported that the main Russian forces dug on the hills in the west. Legion is with them probably, but I do not know where is their base.

$ DI-1-Contact
- Capitan Ironside reports on orders mayor!

$ DM-2-Contact
- Ironside! We do not have ammo. Send us some transports.

$ DI-2-Contact
- Something else?

$ DM-3-Contact
- We should give those Arabian dogs a lesson. From time to time they are doing some raids on my base with hovercrafts. They must have a base somewhere around.

$ DI-3-Contact
- Something else?

$ DM-4-Contact
- Russians of course. Reds are will not rest until they kill us. Destroying their base should solve the problem for some time.

$ DI-4-Contact
- That is all?

$ DM-5-Contact
- For now. My crew is holding the front line, in case of the enemy's attack. If the attack I will need help.
